# StarCraft 2 Complete Lore and Universe Guide

## Ancient Origins - The Xel'Naga

### The Creator Race

The **Xel'Naga** (meaning "Those who came before" or "Wanderers from afar") are an ancient extra-galactic race that arrived in the Milky Way galaxy tens of millions of years ago. They are obsessed with the seeding of life throughout the universe and follow a cosmic philosophy centered around two fundamental principles:

- **Purity of Form**: The potential for great psionic powers and advanced consciousness
- **Purity of Essence**: The ability to continuously evolve and adapt through assimilating other species

### The Infinite Cycle

The Xel'Naga believe the universe follows a cyclical pattern where they must create perfect beings to continue the cosmic cycle. Their ultimate goal is to find or create species that embody both purities, allowing them to ascend and pass on their role as universe shepherds.

### The Great Schism

The Xel'Naga eventually split into two factions:
1. **Traditional Xel'Naga**: Believed in non-interference and natural evolution
2. **Amon's Faction**: Sought to break the cycle and create a static, "perfect" universe

## The Three Great Races
