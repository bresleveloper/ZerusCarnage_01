# Task 01: Initialize Zerg Larvae Character

## Overview
Added a movable Zerg larvae character to JungleWorld.ts that can be controlled with WASD/arrow keys and features collision detection with trees and bushes.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Character Design
- **Visual**: Funny/cute Zerg larvae with purple/pink color scheme
- **Components**:
  - Main body (ellipsoid, purple #AA55AA)
  - Head (sphere, lighter purple #DD77DD)
  - Eyes (black spheres)
  - Body segments (decreasing in size towards tail)
  - Tentacles (4 small cylinders around base)
- **Positioning**: Spawns at world center (0, 0, 0)

### 2. Movement System Changes
- **Before**: WASD/arrow keys moved the camera around the world
- **After**: WASD/arrow keys move the larvae character
- **Speed**: 150 units per second (same as previous camera speed)
- **Bounds**: Character movement limited by existing cameraBounds (-100 to 100 on both axes)

### 3. Collision Detection
- **System**: Circular collision detection using distance calculations
- **Larvae Radius**: 2 units
- **Tree Collision**: Distance < larvae radius + 3 units (tree collision radius)
- **Bush Collision**: Distance < larvae radius + 1.5 units (bush collision radius)
- **Performance**: Checks all 85 objects (25 trees + 60 bushes) each frame
- **Behavior**: Movement is blocked if collision would occur

### 4. Camera Follow System
- **Type**: Direct camera following (no lag/smoothing)
- **Behavior**: Camera position matches larvae position exactly
- **Maintains**: Original camera zoom (8x) and perspective settings

## Technical Implementation

### Key Methods Added:
- `createLarvae()`: Creates the character model with multiple THREE.js primitives
- `checkCollision(position)`: Returns true if position would collide with obstacles
- `updateCameraFollow()`: Updates camera to follow larvae position

### Modified Methods:
- `updateMovement()`: Now moves larvae instead of camera, includes collision checking

### New Properties:
- `private larvae!: THREE.Group`: The character group containing all visual components

## Usage
- **W/Up Arrow**: Move larvae up (positive Y)
- **S/Down Arrow**: Move larvae down (negative Y)
- **A/Left Arrow**: Move larvae left (negative X)
- **D/Right Arrow**: Move larvae right (positive X)
- **E**: Export canvas (unchanged functionality)

## Character Appearance
The Zerg larvae is designed to be endearing and humorous while staying true to the StarCraft universe:
- Segmented body with decreasing size towards the tail
- Large head with prominent black eyes
- Small tentacles for movement
- Purple/pink color scheme typical of Zerg biology
- Low-poly design fitting the game's simple 3D aesthetic

## Future Enhancements
- Add smooth camera following with lag
- Implement larvae animation (tentacle movement, body bobbing)
- Add sound effects for movement and collisions
- Optimize collision detection with spatial partitioning
- Add larvae abilities (morphing, burrowing, etc.)
